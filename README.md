## Instructions

Open the index.html to view the game. Simply start clicking a square to start a game. You can turn over 2 cards for each turn. If they match then they will turn green and be locked open. Otherwise they will turn themselves back over. The aim of the game is to find all the pairs.

The game allows you to achieve different star ratings:

- If you finish the game in 10 turns or under you'll get 3 stars.
- If you take longer than 10 but fewer than 15 turns you'll get 2 stars.
- Anything longer than 15 will give you 1 star.
